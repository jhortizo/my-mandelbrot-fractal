# Plotting the Mandelbrot Fractal

The very first thing I did when learning Python. This goes back to 2017. I found it while tidying some docs and just wanted to keep it here to remind me of the joy of programming ðŸ¥¹.

I am adding venv packages specifications with poetry for easy reproducibility, but clearly it does not uses anything fancy.

It is full of comments in Spanish, which is just cute. I am keeping everything as it was.

Feel free to use it for anything.
